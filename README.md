# Object Store Rust Template

Fastly Object Store is a globally consistent key-value storage accessible across the Fastly Network. This makes it possible for your Compute@Edge application to read and write from Object-stores. The application shows how to use Fastly Object Store within a Rust Compute@Edge application.

**For more details about other starter kits for Compute@Edge, see the [Fastly developer hub](https://developer.fastly.com/solutions/starters)**

## Getting Started

### Installing the Fastly CLI

The [Fastly CLI](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/tools/cli/) is available for multiple operating systems.

- **MacOS**: Install from Homebrew:

    ```
    brew install fastly/tap/fastly
    ```

- **Windows**: [Visit the GitHub repository](https://github.com/fastly/cli/releases/latest) to download the prebuilt binary for your architecture.
- **Linux**: Packages are available for many distributions, along with prebuilt binaries. [Visit the GitHub repository](https://github.com/fastly/cli/releases/latest) to download the package for your distribution.

### Initialise a new application

Create a new Fastly Compute@Edge project using this template:

```shell
fastly compute init --from https://github.com/JakeChampion/object-store-rust-template
```

### Run the application locally

To run the application locally we only need to run one command:

```shell
fastly compute serve
```

The application should now be running on <http://127.0.0.1:7676>

The `fastly.toml` file has a section named `[local_server]` which contains the configuration for Object Store when running locally.

## Understanding the code

### [./src/main.rs](./src/main.rs)

A single main function is defined which uses the [`#[fastly::main]` macro](https://docs.rs/fastly/latest/fastly/attr.main.html), this is the function that recieves the incoming `Request` and returns a `Result<Response>`, which will be sent to the user-agent.

## Deploying the project to Fastly

Note that Fastly Services have to have unique names within a Fastly Account.

To create and deploy to a new Fastly Service run the command and follow the instructions:

```shell
fastly compute publish
```

That is it, we now have a Fastly Service, a Fastly Object Store and have them linked together!

You can view real-time logs for the Fastly Service by running:
```shell
fastly log-tail
```

## Adding entries to the Object Store

It is possible to add key-value pairs to an Object Store using the Fastly CLI like so:
```shell
fastly objectstore insert --id=$FASTLY_OBJECT_STORE_ID --k=$KEY --v=$VALUE
```

For example, here is how you could add to the Object Store named `my-store` a key named `readme` whose value is the contents of `README.md`:
```shell
fastly objectstore get --id="$(fastly objectstore list | grep -A 3 'my-store' | tail -n 1 | grep -o '[a-z0-9]*')" --k="readme" --v="$(cat README.md)"
```
